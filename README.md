## Overview
I started this project with lots of enthusiasm as it is my first project that is somewhat like something I could be hired to do irl.
I am a 15 year old front end dev to be. I gladly accept any constructive criticism!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  * something that was irritating me a bit is how the background on desktop view moves as the screen size changes.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code


### What I learned

I think the most important thing this problem helped me learn is the use of media queries to make a responsive website.




### Continued development

I definitely want to expand my knowledge in media queries in the next projects. Something I also need to learn more about is different ways to center a div properly.
